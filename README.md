# Automatic-Dustbin


This automatic dustbin is a DIY project made by me in which is interfaced it with the Arduino UNO micro-controller. I used HC SR-04 (Ultrasonic) sensor and SG90 Micro Servo to detect the range and open the lid respectively. To program the micro-controller, we have to use Arduino IDE which is free to install and can get it from [arduino.cc](https://arduino.cc). A complete documentation is avilable for working of Ultrasonic sensor and Micro Servo. You can follow these steps below to make it at your home.



# Components Required
1. Arduino UNO microcontroller
2. Breadboard
3. Jumper Wires
4. HCSR-04 Ultrasonic Sensor
5. SG90 Micro Servo
6. One LED
7. Other (glue, thread, etc.)

(NOTE: You can use any type of box for making a dustbin, the only concept is object detection and how you want to open the dustbin using a servo)
